# LA Clippers Basketball Full-Stack Developer Questions & Answers



Q: **How did you end up at your undergraduate school? How did you choose your major? What appealed to you about it?**

A: I attended Utah State University because they offered me a full-ride scholarship with the option to defer for 2 years while I completed a volunteer service mission in Tampa, FL. I also loved the feeling of a close-knit college town in the the Utah mountains. I'm really happy with the experience that I had there, not just in my education but also in the lasting relationships that I formed there with friends and my now-wife. 

I had known since about my sophomore year of high school that I wanted to major in Computer Science and dedicate my career to technology, though I wasn't sure exactly what field I preferred. During college, I seriously considered a career path into Data Science specifically. I took statistics, machine learning, and data science classes, and was Secretary on the Data Science club for a year which gave me great exposure. My initial interest in data science was because I knew that it was a valuable skill in NBA front offices, and it's been my dream job since graduating high school to work in technology for an NBA team. 

Around my senior year of college, I decided that I enjoyed the day-to-day work of full stack software development more than constantly being focused on data engineering and the other tasks involved with data science. Also around this time was when I first saw postings for full stack developers in NBA front offices. With that in mind, I chose to focus more on full stack development as I began my career, with my end goal still being to work for an NBA team.

Q: **Please list the computer programs, full stack libraries, and other computational tools you are familiar with including your proficiency and a brief description on what you used the tool for.**


#### Fluent
- Javascript: Learned JS in high school and have built multiple web applications across different fields.
- Vue/Nuxt: Recently spent a year and a half at Maiden Voyage building web applications whose frontends were in Vue. Have built multiple Nuxt side projects in my free time.
- Python: About half of my college courses at USU were in Python, and I've built a couple of web apps in Django. School experience with Pandas and numpy for scientific computing and machine learning.
- Java: About the other half of my college courses at USU were in Java. I completed an internship at FamilySearch in a team building Java Spring Boot web apps.
- PHP/Laravel: Learned PHP in high school and spent a year and a half at Maiden Voyage building full-stack web apps with Laravel backends.
- Git version control
- TailwindCSS
- HTML & CSS

#### Very Confident
- SQL: I don't claim to be a SQL expert, but I have a lot of experience with SQL and relational databases. I've mostly worked with MySQL and PostgreSQL, as well as with Javascript, Django, and Laravel ORMs. During my internship at HealthCatalyst, one of my tasks was to refactor some complex SQL stored procedures used in data pipelines.
- AWS & Other Clouds: I took an Amazon sponsored AWS class at Utah State, and used AWS during work at FamilySearch and Maiden Voyage. I also used the Azure cloud extensively during my HealthCatalyst internship. I have experience working with serverless functions, partitioning databases and VPS, managing roles and permissions, etc. 
- Django: I built two Django web apps during college for group projects. One was a basic web app, the other was a D3.js data visualization tool which seeded NBA data to a local database from csv files and then used it to show halfcourt FG% heatmaps, FG% / time throughout games, and a couple other visualizations based on player data.
- Ionic: Built a hybrid mobile app using Ionic for the Women's Council of Realtors Utah (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wcr-utah/id6449136010) 
- Ubuntu / WSL2: Have developed in WSL2 environments both at school and during my time at Maiden Voyage.

#### Some Exposure
- React: I built the first version of my static portfolio website in React, and have recently been using Next.js to build a couple of side projects. Have been exposed to elements such as RSCs, hooks, shadcn/ui, Clerk auth, Vercel, etc. 
- R: I took a class on R in college and used it to get NBA data for a data visualization project.
- Go: I recently learned Golang and used it to build a simple REST API backend that performed CRUD on a PostgreSQL database.
- C#: I completed an internship at HealthCatalyst building Azure Functions (lambdas) in C# as part of a complex data ingestion and transformation pipeline.
- Node.js: I don't have extensive experience with Node.js backends, but I've learned about it and would be comfortable porting my general skills in backend development to Node.js. Have built a custom in-house npm package for sharing Vue components across different projects at Maiden Voyage.


Q: **List 3 websites or apps that annoy you (functionally/aesthetically). In your opinion whatâ€™s wrong with them? How would you fix them?**
A: 
1. amazon.com: The Amazon UI is too cluttered. For instance, a simple product search on Amazon returns a page featuring a top navigation bar for unrelated products, as well as a complex filter sidebar. Having so much text on the page is overwhelming. I would improve this UI by focusing on a functional search bar, replacing the top navigation bar with a suggested or related searches feature on the side, and collapsing most of the filter sidebar by default. It would also be nice to display product titles which are clear and concise rather than long unreadable SEO slop. ![Amazon screenshot](/public/img/amazon.png)
2. yahoo.com: Across the web, articles have been cursed with the proliferation of ads. Often articles are so covered in hovering videos, popups, cookie disclaimers, etc, that the article itself is almost impossible to read. While this is more indicative of a larger problem on the web, my philosophy is that providing premium user experiences is the best way to drive engagement and revenue. To improve the specific screenshot below, I would remove all of the ads, or at least place them on the sides of the page. I'd center the article content. ![Yahoo screenshot](/public/img/yahoo.png)
3. basketball-reference.com: Lastly, Basketball Reference is actually very functional, but could do with a bit of a design refresh in my opinion. There is a lot of text, a lot of traditional blue hyperlinks styled with the default blue color and underline, and overall the design feels outdated. I would transition from three columns layout to more of a vertical layout to keep the same content accessible, but give a clearer path for the eye to follow. I would replace sections full of hyperlinks with a collection of cards. For instance, the Trending Player Pages section could replace their list of links with cards featuring the player's image. In general, most of the visual elements could benefit from dedicated UI components. ![Basketball Reference screenshot](/public/img/bref.png)

Q: **What is the hardest thing you ever programmed? Why was it difficult? How did you overcome the difficulty?**

A: While I feel that all of the software that I've worked on have had their moments of frustration, one challenge that I'll call out occurred while I was an intern at HealthCatalyst. My role there was as a Cloud Software Intern on a data streaming team deep within the engineering hierarchy. Our team was in charge of one step along a complex data pipeline. Upon joining, I had to quickly get up to speed on both the programming environment (.NET) which was new to me, and learn the specific details of the pipeline architecture so that I understood the context of our work. 

A few weeks into this, I was tasked with engineering tests for an Azure function (lambda) doing data transformations to ensure that various calculations were being performed correctly. I had a deadline, because we were planning to demo this feature to the rest of our department in a couple of weeks. In that time, I learned C# and the surrounding architecture and implemented a testing solution that worked. I faced a lot of bugs along the way, and the pressure of delivering in a tight timeframe was stressful. When the time for the demo came, I was able to successfully present the software I'd designed to the rest of the engineers in our department. I overcame the pressure and hurdle of learning on the fly by relying on my teammates where it made sense, and continuing to think about the software even after I'd signed off for the day. Ultimately, the attributes of teamwork, diligence, and patience that I applied there are the same skills that are necessary when faced with any difficult task.


Q: **What online (sports/programming/statistics) communities do you read and/or participate in on a regular basis?**

A: I'm a founding subscriber and regular listener to Dunc'd On Prime, an NBA podcast hosted by Nate Duncan and Danny Leroux. I also follow the league closely through Twitter, where I follow many players, front office executives, media members, and tech-focused NBA accounts. Besides the NBA, I also enjoy watching Youtube videos and listening to podcasts such as Syntax to stay up to date on the current state of web development and get introduced to new technologies. I enjoy watching the AI Explained YouTube channel to learn about the latest advancements in AI.

Q: **Have you ever taught yourself something? What was it? Why did you learn it? How did you learn it?**

A: As I've been looking for a job recently and working on my portfolio, I've been working on a few side projects that use technologies such as Next, Supabase, SST, and Golang. There is some element of this that is aimed at improving my portfolio to land a job, but it's also become a genuine hobby of mine. One such project is Grimoire, a fantasy worldbuilding tool that I'm building for my friends who play DnD and as an outlet for my other hobby generating AI art. I've found that the most effective way for me to learn new skills (especially technology) is to begin building or attempting something which I am genuinely interested in making. Along the way, I have to solve problems that I haven't faced before, so I use Google and AI tools like Claude to help me overcome obstacles. In this way I gain experience that's more lasting than just following a Youtube tutorial.


Q: **Over the last 4 years, what single skill did you develop that you think would be the most valuable for this role and what single skill did you develop that you think would be the least valuable for this role? Why? How did you go about developing those two skills?**

A: In the past four years, I've finished my bachelors, graduated, spent a year and a half working at a startup, and gotten married. I'd say the most valuable skill I've developed is a better understanding of the entire software development lifecycle. I've gained experience deploying applications to production and overseeing the development of applications from start to finish. While I've been programming since I was 14, it wasn't until recently that I'd gained enough comprehensive experience to feel qualified to call myself a full stack developer. This understanding will be valuable working in a fast-paced and small team environment like an NBA front office because it will allow me to tackle challenges as executives present them. If Lawrence Frank or anyone else in the front office has a sudden need for a tool, I can build it from start to finish and be confident doing so.

I don't really believe that any of the skills that I've developed would be totally useless. Soft skills such as client communication or time management are obviously portable to any industry or role. Even specific technologies still involve learning principles that are transferrable across tech stacks. Perhaps something totally unrelated to software development, sports, or statistics, like my time spent earning an economics minor could be considered less valuable. In general though, I am a proponent of the ideas summarized in the book "Range" by David Epstein. By developing a broad set of skills, I am better equipped to be creative, agile, and make connections that more specialized people might overlook.

Q: **What interests you about working for a basketball team? How do you think a Basketball Front Office could maximize your development?**

A: Since becoming obsessed with the NBA as a teenager, I've dreamed of working for an NBA team. This position with the LA Clippers would be the fulfillment of that dream. The joy that I feel from software development comes when I finally find the solution to a problem, and see the value the final product brings. I expect that joy to only be greater when it is within an industry and context that I am passionate about. 

I also see this position in the front office as an opportunity for me to continue my pattern of accepting positions that challenge me and force me to grow. As mentioned before, the small size of the front office and fast pace at which decisions need to be made present an opportunity for me to learn quickly and push the limits of my ability to engineer efficiently.
